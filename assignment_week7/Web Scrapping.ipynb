    "\n",
    "1. Simplifies web scraping: Beautiful Soup abstracts away the complexities of parsing HTML and XML, providing a user-friendly interface for extracting data from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handles imperfect markup: It can handle poorly formatted or invalid HTML and XML documents, allowing scraping from real-world websites that may have inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Supports powerful querying: Beautiful Soup provides robust methods for searching and navigating parsed documents, using CSS selectors, XPath expressions, or custom filters, making it easier to locate and extract specific data elements."
