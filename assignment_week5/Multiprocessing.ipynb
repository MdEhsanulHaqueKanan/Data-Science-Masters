    "Answer: Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a program to utilize multiple processors or CPU cores to execute tasks in parallel.\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful in Python to achieve true parallelism, as it enables different processes to run simultaneously and independently, utilizing separate memory spaces. This is particularly beneficial for CPU-intensive tasks, as they can be distributed across multiple cores, leading to improved performance and reduced execution time.\n",
    "By leveraging multiprocessing, Python programs can overcome the limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and harness the full potential of modern multicore processors, resulting in enhanced computational power and scalability."

    "Answer: Here are the main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execution Model: \n",
    "In multiprocessing, multiple processes run independently, each with its own memory space. In multithreading, multiple threads share the same memory space within a single process.\n",
    "2. Resource Utilization: \n",
    "Multiprocessing can utilize multiple CPUs or cores for parallel execution, while multithreading is limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, allowing only one thread to execute at a time, even on multicore systems.\n",
    "3. Complexity: \n",
    "Multithreading is generally easier to implement and has less overhead, while multiprocessing requires more complex synchronization mechanisms and has higher overhead due to inter-process communication."
