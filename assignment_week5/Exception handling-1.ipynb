    "Answer: In Python, an exception is an event or condition that interrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. When an exceptional situation occurs, such as an error or an unexpected behavior, an exception is raised. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "1. Nature of Errors:\n",
    "Syntax errors are related to violations of the language's grammar rules and occur when the code structure or syntax is incorrect. They are detected during the parsing or compilation phase.\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the execution of a program when an exceptional condition or error is encountered. They can happen even if the code's syntax is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Occurrence:\n",
    "Syntax errors are typically detected before the program's execution begins, during the parsing or compilation phase. They prevent the program from running.\n",
    "Exceptions, however, occur at runtime when the program is executing. They can be raised explicitly using the raise statement or raised implicitly by built-in functions or methods when certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling:\n",
    "Syntax errors must be fixed in the code before the program can be executed. They require identifying and correcting the code structure or syntax that violates the language's rules.\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, can be caught and handled by the program using exception handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks. By handling exceptions, the program can gracefully recover from errors, prevent crashes, and continue execution.\n"
