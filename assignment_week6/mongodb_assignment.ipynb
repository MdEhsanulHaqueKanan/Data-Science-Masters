    "Answer: MongoDB is a type of database that stores information in a flexible and scalable way. It's particularly good at handling large amounts of data and is often used in modern web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database that stores and retrieves data in a flexible manner, without using traditional tabular relations like in a spreadsheet. They allow for faster and more scalable data management, making them suitable for handling large volumes of diverse data in modern applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible and evolving data structure: MongoDB is suitable when the data structure is likely to change or evolve over time, as it doesn't enforce a rigid schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data: If your data doesn't fit well into a tabular structure, MongoDB's document-oriented model allows for efficient storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. High scalability and performance: MongoDB excels in horizontal scalability, making it a good choice for applications that require high performance and need to handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Agile development and rapid iterations: MongoDB's flexible schema and document-based structure enable developers to iterate quickly and adapt to changing requirements during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Real-time analytics and caching: MongoDB's flexible data model and built-in caching capabilities make it well-suited for real-time analytics and caching use cases.\n"

    "2. Scalability: It supports horizontal scaling, allowing for distributed data storage across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Replication and failover: MongoDB provides built-in replication and failover mechanisms to ensure data durability and availability.\n",
    "\n",
